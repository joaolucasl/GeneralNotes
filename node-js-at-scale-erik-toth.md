  # [Node.js at Scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvDtEcQdGs0)
  -  *Erik Toth* - _Engineering Manager @ Paypal_


  ##  Scaling People:
    Educate people on Node best-practices, ecosystem, from different ranges of backgrounds and stacks.  It is about educating people and helping people to feel confortable in this environment.
    "Just writing code isn't enough; You have to help people actively develop their skills for both your benefit and theirs;"
  ## Scaling Processes:
    Adapt the processes that are defined for other stacks and to create and improve them to a better fit with Node.
    Processes doesn't always have to scale up. In Paypal, it scaled down. Engineers have to understand the weight of their decisions in the overall system and the consequences of those. 
    Thinking about design before you start coding create meaningful and powerful software. 
    Making developers aware of the deployment and give them freedom to understand their code behaviours in production. That empowers developers for better decision making.
  ## Scaling Technology:
    How to integrate Node with the current environments and techonologies and how to leverage NodeJS at its greatest potential;
    Node project isn't usually the problem, but it handling requests and dispatching them so fast may be.
    Find bottlenecks, understand the decisions behind those sections. Look for better performing options.
